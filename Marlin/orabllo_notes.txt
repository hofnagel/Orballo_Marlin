Notes on E-step calculations for this Orballo

Z axis on Orballo 
2x threaded rod M5x295 mm

steps_per_mm = (motor_steps_per_rev * driver_microstep) / thread_pitch
 // NEMA 17 with standard pitch M5 threaded rod:
(200 * 16) / 0.8 = 4000

However, since Z motors are using the newer stepper chip the calc is (200 * 32) / 0.8 = 8000

Bowden Instructions from RepRap Champion:

Calculating Esteps for the extruder is simple:

Please take into an account filament gear driving diameter - 10.95 mm and calculate circumference of the gear - 10.95 x 3.14 =   34.38mm.
Next calculation step will depend on the type of stepper motor you use and stepper driver setting. 
Let's take widely used 1.8 deg/step stepper motor with stepper driver settings of 1/16 step. 

1.8 deg/step stepper will have 200 steps per one full rotation. 
We multiply that by 16, because 1/16 setting on the driver will give 16 times of 200. 16 x 200 = 3200 steps per rev with 1/16 stepper driver settings.
Last step is calculate actual Estep parameter to put into firmware. It will be 3200 / 34.38mm = 93 steps per mm. Use this value in the firmware

Note: since the extruder uses the newer motor driver the esteps is actually ( 200 * 32 ) / 34.38 = 186.15
